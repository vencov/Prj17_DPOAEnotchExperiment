# Minima in Cubic Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emission Input/Output Functions due to Distributed Primary Sources

This repository supplements the publication titled *"Minima in Cubic Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emission Input/Output Functions due to Distributed Primary Sources"* by Václav Vencovský and Aleš Vetešník, accepted by the JASA Express Letters on 14 August 2024.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following materials to supplement the publication:

- **Data**: Experimental and simulated data supporting the findings in the paper.
- **Code**: Scripts used for data analysis, simulation, and plotting.
- **Figures**: High-resolution images of figures used in the paper.


## Requirements

To run the scripts and reproduce the results, you will need the following software and libraries:

- Matlab


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `code` directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name/code
   ```

To analyze experimental data, you must download them from shared google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lwhNR3eNBCrk9vQZMAWvUdxt4uWck_G0?usp=sharing. Copy the folder Experiments into the main folder of the github project.

### Viewing Figures

Figures used in the publication can be found in the `figures` directory. You can view them directly using any image viewer or open the corresponding notebooks to regenerate them.
